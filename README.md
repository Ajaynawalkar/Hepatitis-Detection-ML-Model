# Hepatitis-Detection-ML-Model
Machine learning model for detection of hepatitis C.
## Technology Used in Project:
- Python programming
- Python Libraries 
- Machine Learning Models
## Context
The data set contains laboratory values of blood donors and Hepatitis C patients and demographic values like age. The data was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/hepatitis-c-dataset
## Problem Statement 
- To detect Hepatitis C in early stage by some standard data.
- Hepatitis C is one of the most commonly spread infections during Blood donation. Its detection is often complex, expensive and time-taking.
- So rather than going through traditional pathway, new approaches are trying to detect Hepatitis C status using Blood biomarkers. In certain cases, attempts have been made to even sub-categorize the stage of Hepatitis C.
- Hepatitis C is a dangerous disease, with high fatility, hence prevention is the best remedy the keep in mind.
## Dataset:
- This dataset contains 14 columns & 615 rows.
- Labelled into 4 classes.
## ML Model Used in project:
1) Decision Tree Classifier = 100%
2) Random Forest Classifier = 97.8%
3) SVM(Support Vector Machine) = 94.05%
## Conclusion
1) The highest correlation with classification was found for AST (glutamate aminotransferase) test values, followed by BIL (bilirubin) and GGT (glutamyl transpeptidase).
2) Transaminases, bilirubin, and glutamyl transpeptidase showed positive correlation with the probability of disease, and the higher the value, the more severe the disease.
3) Age, sex, bilirubin, and cholesterol did not have a significant degree of association with the probability of disease.
4) The Decision Tree Classifier has the Highest Accuracy 100%.
